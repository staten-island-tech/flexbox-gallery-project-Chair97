        <p class="card-description">
          A light and strong supercar shaped by the forces of nature. Honed by
          the elements. Poised for attack. And ferociously fast. Yet beautifully
          made, tactile and effortlessly usable, every day. The McLaren 720S is
          purposeful and radical.

          The car’s name encapsulates the true significance of all that has been
          achieved in terms of performance. The reference to the 90th
          anniversary of the foundation of Scuderia Ferrari underscores the
          strong link that has always existed between Ferrari’s track and road
          cars.

          easy to lose the genuine thrill of driving. But in the future shaped
          by Lamborghini, this won’t be left behind, because there will always
          be a driver behind the wheel.
